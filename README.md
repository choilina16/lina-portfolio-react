# Professional Portfolio

Hi, my name is Lina Choi. I am a 1st generation Korean-American, born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. My husband and I live in Dacula, Georgia with our 3-year-old, mixed-breed dog named Miller (and yes, he's named after Miller Lite #itsmillertime). Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling, golfing, and gardening. During the pandemic, I've accumulated a fair bit of houseplants. Far more than a normal person should!
